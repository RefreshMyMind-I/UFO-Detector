# ðŸ›¸ UFO-Detecor - A simple UFO detection tool ðŸ›¸

 This is a project dedicated to using image recogition technology to create an internet-accessible program for classifying known and unknown objects within the view of a telescope.

Welcome to the **DIY UFO Detector**, automated *AI* and *Telescope* enabled :alien: .

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT

With all of the hubub going on in the US, with ATIP, and the pentagon being forced to declassify documentation regarding un-identifed flying obejects - I have decided to build an open-source and automated classification system for a telescope and/or a lensed camera(s).

The idea of the project is to look to the skies and attempt to classify everything known to humans to fly in the sky (over a certain geo-specific area - this software uses geo-location to ensure performance on your machine, and to simplify the training).

The objects that are outside of the scope of the trained dataset are placed into a folder for further classification inorder to weed out errors and smudges. The final filtered results are then left for human classification.
